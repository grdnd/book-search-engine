## Description

MERN-Bookies is a book search engine that runs on the Google Books API. It allows users to browse through google's library of books, and enables them to save/delete their favorite books for reference or future purchase.

This application was built with the modern technologies of the `MERN` stack, along with implementation of the `ApolloServer` for `GraphQL`.
